What a backend actually is (stop the value thinking)
Ans:  A backend is not
Express , APIs , Databases

A backend is : A long -running program that  listens for requests ,
executes logic , talks to external systems (DB ,cache , APIs) and return
responses.

Frontend :sends requests
Backend : decides what to do
Database: storing data


2)How  Node js actually works (important)
Node js 
1)Runs Javascript outside the browser.
2)Uses V8 engine (same as Chrome).
3)Is single-threaded
4)Uses event loop + non-blocking I/O.

Why this matters
Node handles thousands of requests without creating thousands of 
threads.

Bad backend devs don't understand this -> they block the event loop->
server dies.


Rule you must remember forever
Never block the event loop (no heavy CPU work , no infinite loops ,no sync
 I/O request path).

3)Install & Verify environment (don't skip)

Required :  Node js LTS (>=18)
            npm (comes with Node)


4) Create your first backend project

mkdir backend 
cd backend 
npm init -y

What package .json actually is 
1) Dependency list 
2)Project metadata
3)Script runner

If you don't understand this file , you don't understand Node.

basic folder structure (discipline starts now):


backend /

    src/
       index.js

    .env
    .gitignore
    package.json


.gitignore
node_modules
.env


.env
PORT =3000


6) Your first Node program(no Express)
src/index.js
console.log("Backend server starting......." )


If this doesn't work ->stop and fix it . This is the base.

7) Understand process (core concept)
Node exposes environment and system info via  process 

Update src/index.js

console.log("PORT" ,process.env.PORT)

Open terminal and run node src/index.js->output will get-> undefined



Why?

Node doesn't read .env automatically.
That's intentional. 



8)Load environment variables properly:
Intall ->dotenv using command npm install dotenv.


import dotenv from "dotenv"
dotenv.config();

console.log("PORT", process.env.PORT)

Note:this will fail unless we fix one thing in package .json  use "type":module
node src/index.js

output in terminal PORT:3000
